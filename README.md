# Make your own HashTable

This week's assignment is to make your own Hash Table.

* Use whatever language you want
* Don't use a built in implementation provide by the language (I mean, c'mon :) )
* A hash table should let get and put elements using a string key, eg.
```
hash.put("foo", "this is a thing")
hash.get("foo") # returns "this is a thing"
```
* Implement a hash function which given the key, returns an index
* Store values in an array using the index

## Collisions

* Initial version can throw an exception when you try to put into the hash and encounter 
a key collision.
* For extra credit, come up with a key collision strategy.
